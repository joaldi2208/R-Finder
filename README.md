- R=Finder is a subprogram of the DECIMER project developed by [Kohulan Rajan](https://github.com/Kohulan) and [Otto Brinkhaus](https://github.com/OBrink). Based on a separately trained tesseract-ocr model and using regular expressions (REGEX), R=Finder identifies R-groups in journals (pdf files) and maps them to their structure found by [DECIMER-image-segmentation](https://github.com/Kohulan/DECIMER-Image-Segmentation) and complements/corrects the given SMILES string generated by a "predictor" program.
